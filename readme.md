# MACAD23 - Cloud based Data Management
## Session 04

Due to recent security updates in github pages and compute, it's not possible to run compute from a github pages site without a custom domain. ([Thanks James](https://iaac-macad.slack.com/team/U044RJ2RFLM) ðŸ˜‰)

For that reason, we've created a custom domain for you guys to put your project:

**http://www.data-mgmt.com/**

### Instructions to collaborate in this repostory

1. Accept invitation to join the MACAD23 github team

3. Create a folder with YourName
4. Upload your code in that folder
5. update this readme.md (below) in the root with your example


you should be able to run your compute project in `http://www.datamgmt.com/{YourFolder}`
- note that the `http`  in that address is really important. `https` wont work with compute
